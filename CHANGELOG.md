## [4.0.1] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed

- **BUG-001**: Fixed LocalizationService singleton race condition under concurrent requests
  - Replaced global singleton mutation with per-locale instance cache (`Map<LocaleCode, LocalizationService>`)
  - `getLocalizedDyeName()` and `getLocalizedCategory()` now accept explicit `locale` parameter
  - Updated all 16 command handlers to pass locale explicitly, eliminating shared mutable state
- **BUG-002**: Fixed budget "no world set" displaying a broken image embed
  - JSON responses cannot carry file attachments; replaced with text-only ephemeral response
- **BUG-003**: Fixed `renameCollection()` missing input sanitization
  - Added `sanitizeCollectionName()` call to match `createCollection()` behavior
  - Prevents control characters, Zalgo text, and invisible Unicode in renamed collections
- **BUG-004**: Added timeouts to `sendFollowUp()` and `editOriginalResponse()` Discord API calls
  - 5-second timeout (`AbortSignal.timeout`) for JSON webhook requests
  - 10-second timeout for multipart/file upload requests (larger payloads need more time)
  - Deadline-aware wrappers (`sendFollowUpWithDeadline`, `editOriginalResponseWithDeadline`) skip calls when Discord's 3-second interaction deadline is exceeded
- **BUG-005**: Fixed GitHub webhook reading entire body before checking payload size
  - Added `Content-Length` header pre-check before `c.req.text()` to reject oversized payloads without buffering
  - Retains post-read body length check as defense-in-depth (in case header is missing or spoofed)
- **BUG-007**: Fixed unique user tracking race condition and unbounded KV value growth
  - Replaced single comma-separated string (`stats:users:{date}`) with individual KV keys (`usertrack:{date}:{userId}`)
  - Eliminates read-modify-write race condition (concurrent requests could lose user IDs)
  - Each key is a fixed 1-byte value with TTL auto-expiry instead of an ever-growing string
  - Read-first optimization conserves KV write quota (100k reads/day free vs 1k writes/day)

### Changed

- **REFACTOR-001**: Consolidated duplicate `resolveDyeInput()` from `favorites.ts` and `collection.ts` into `utils/color.ts`
  - Fixes subtle Facewear fallback bug: previously returned a Facewear dye when all search results were Facewear, now correctly returns `null`
  - Both deprecated handlers import from the single shared implementation
- **REFACTOR-002**: Consolidated 9 duplicate `DyeService` instantiations into single shared singleton
  - `utils/color.ts` exports the canonical `dyeService` instance; all other files now import it
  - Eliminates 8 redundant `new DyeService(dyeDatabase)` calls across `index.ts`, `dye.ts`, `favorites.ts`, `collection.ts`, `match-image.ts`, `preset.ts`, `swatch.ts`, and `budget-calculator.ts`
- **REFACTOR-004**: Localized all preferences command strings across 6 languages
  - Preference key labels, display values, validation messages, and subcommand responses use `t.t('preferences.*')` i18n keys
  - ~30 locale keys added to en, ja, de, fr, ko, zh locale files

### Performance

- **OPT-001**: Added 1-hour in-memory cache for world/datacenter autocomplete data
  - `getWorldAutocomplete()` and `validateWorld()` now use cached results
  - Eliminates redundant HTTP requests on every Discord autocomplete keystroke
- **OPT-002**: Pre-filter dyes by color distance before fetching market prices in `/budget find`
  - Calculates color distance (CPU-only) for all 136 tradeable dyes, then fetches prices only for candidates within `maxDistance`
  - Reduces Universalis API calls by 70–85% on cold cache (typically 15–40 candidates instead of 136)
- **OPT-004**: Removed unnecessary SVG→PNG generation in budget "no world set" path
  - The rendered image was never attached to the response (wasted ~50-100ms CPU per invocation)

### Dependencies

- Bumped `@cloudflare/workers-types` to 4.20260207.0
- Bumped `hono` to 4.11.9
- Bumped `@types/node` to 25.2.2

- `/favorites` → Soft deprecated, points to `/preset` with deprecation warnings
- `/collection` → Soft deprecated, points to `/preset` with deprecation warnings
- Command registration updated with `[DEPRECATED]` prefixes

#### Command Registration (Phase 8)

### Security

#### Dependency Security Audit (2026-02-06)
- **FINDING-001** (auth): JWT signature verification now uses `crypto.subtle.verify()` for timing-safe comparison
- **FINDING-002** (auth): HMAC base64url verification upgraded to timing-safe `crypto.subtle.verify()`
- **FINDING-003** (rate-limiter): `getClientIp()` now supports `trustXForwardedFor` option to disable spoofable header fallback
- **FINDING-005** (logger): Added 6 new secret redaction patterns (`client_secret`, `private_key`, `signing_key`, `webhook_secret`, `auth_token`, `credentials`)
- **FINDING-006** (rate-limiter): IP addresses normalized to lowercase, preventing IPv6 case mismatches in rate-limit keys
- **FINDING-007** (rate-limiter): KV key delimiter changed to avoid ambiguity with IPv6 colons
- **FINDING-008** (logger): Context field redaction now recurses into nested objects (up to 3 levels)
- Full audit report: `xivdyetools-docs/audits/2026-02-06/SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md`

### Fixed

- `/extractor image` quality badges (EXCELLENT, GOOD, FAIR) now vertically centered in each palette row instead of aligned to bottom text baseline
- `/swatch` grid command registration now advertises 1-based row/col ranges matching handler validation
- `/budget` command failures resolved:
  - Use `fetchPricesBatched` for >100 dyes on cold cache
  - Rewrite Universalis aggregated API response parsing to match actual array-based format
  - Filter Facewear dyes with synthetic negative itemIDs (`itemID > 0`)
  - Migrate from legacy user-preferences to unified preferences system
  - Added full i18n support with CJK font fallbacks for SVG graphic

### Performance

- Migrated component context storage from KV to Cache API (eliminates ~1 KV write per interactive command)
- Migrated price cache from KV to Cache API (eliminates ~136 KV writes per `/budget` command)
- Migrated rate limiting from KV to Upstash Redis (atomic operations, eliminates race conditions from DISCORD-BUG-001)
  - Upstash preferred when configured, automatic fallback to KV if not
  - Uses Redis `INCR` for truly atomic counter increments
  - 10,000 free commands/day vs KV's 1,000 writes/day
- All migrations combined keep the worker well within free-tier limits

  - `isValidHex()` - Supports both 6-digit and optional 3-digit shorthand validation
  - `normalizeHex()` - Ensures `#` prefix and expands 3-digit to 6-digit (`#F00` → `#FF0000`)

## [2.1.1] - 2025-12-15

### Fixed
